My porgram keeps dying.
Its always on this line:

/* Create an empty porg template.
 * The porg's id will be written to *porgid
 * You can then use porgadd_* to customise the porg
 * and porgrun() to run it.
 * Returns 0 on succes, or -1 and sets porglib_errno on fail.
 * if porgid is NULL, dry-run - create no new porg, but write to porglib_errno the same.
 */
int porgmak(porg_t* porgid);

That's a PROTOTYPE. This is a RUNTIME error.
I've tried a full recompile - both on my laptop and my rasp pi. Still crashing.
TBH, I think this is a compiler error - I am using an experimental one - but nobody else has this problem?
And yes, I tried going step-by-step on gdb. It's behaving fine, then it randomly segv's. gdb, that is. gdb segv's.
