[sudox]	Hey whats up
[zoop]	So some people are saying that Manchester is rainier than leeds.
[sudox]	Ok
[zoop]	But some people are saying that Leeds is rainier!
[sudox]	Yikes
[zoop]	And everybody agrees that Cardiff is the rainiest.
[sudox]	...
[zoop]	And the hottest AND the coldest!
[sudox]	Maybe you should get off the quantum mechanics weather station?
[zoop]	HOW? HOW?! I NEED TO FIND OUT WHY?!

[zoop]	And NOW it's saying that I need to touch grass, but earlier it said that it was raining, so the grass would be wet.
[sudox]	Please do not check your /etc/hosts
[zoop]	How did you even do that?
