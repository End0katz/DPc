# The solution to end all scammers

How to stop all* scammers:
	Instead of a deny-list of people who you have blocked,
	keep an allow-list of people you have unblocked.

This stops all* scammers.

*may be less effective if your friends are likely to be hacked, or if there is no authentication

<Title Text>:
If you don't know them, they can't hurt you* *unless they physically come to your house
