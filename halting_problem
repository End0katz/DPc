# The halting problem

I don't understand why the halting problem is so hard.
Eventually, users ^C. Computers poweroff. Batteries deplete.
CPUs derode. RAM disintigrates. Suns expand and engulf processes in flame and fusion.

HALTING PROBLEM: EXISTENTIAL EDITION:

def halts(f):
	return True

<Title Text>:
def paradox(f): while halts(f): pass
