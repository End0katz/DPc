# Linux distros and other OSes

Windows			Ah, I see you have borrowed a computer from MS. Oh, you think it's you computer? ha.
OS X			I mean, it's a start.
Ubuntu			Welcome.
Debian			Level Up. Add 1 point to STR, CON, DEX, WIS, CHR or INT
Fedora			IDK, is it nice?
Arch			Are you using it for up-to-date software, customizations or bragging rights.
Gentoo			You... actually did it? Well Done!
Custom Distro		A power user
No OS- Just Kernel	A TRUE power user
UEFI			Probably smart enough to use lisp
BIOS			Isn't that obsolete?

<Title Text>:
CPU Microcode		So you deleted your laptop and instead of getting a new one, you just used it as a weird flex?
