# Analyse

So, let me get this straight.

Some random internet guy published his book on social media, and someone else wrote a 20-paragraph well-researched scathing review (its a good book).
You then misunderstood your university homework and wrote an analasis on the review not the book.
Then, you posted it online, and I misunderstood my university homework...

<Title Text>:
So, I did a linguistic analasis on your clarfication post...
