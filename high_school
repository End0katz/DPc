# High School

y7		Miscreants exploit new freedom of phones and swearing and not being in primary anymore
y8		Miscreants have settled in and are now argumentative
y9		Miscreants no longer fear y10/11 and are now insufferable
y10/11		Miscreants have either cooled down, skive lessons completely, or no longer go to this school
University	Varies from uni to uni

<Title Text>:
Adult life	You have other problems to worry about than miscreants. IT'S TAXING TIME!
