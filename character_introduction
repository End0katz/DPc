Because I can't use stick figures without feeling like i'm copying xkcd, I will instead use Hypothetical Chat (HC).
In HC, a <chat> is private and a <thread> is public. A <post> is like a thread but only the creator can post.

[sudox]	Apparently some NASA employee hacked SpaceX
[zoop]	You mean NSA? right?
[sudox]	no.
[sudox] It wasn't because the company asked him too, he was trying to hack tesla but took a wrong turn.
[zoop]	I can't find anything about this online.
[sudox]	Not public knowledge yet.
[zoop]	Then how do you know.
[sudox]	I was "accidentally" included in the list of recipiants for the email saying why the best coder on team A was fired.
[zoop]	How?

[zoop]	You know the advice yiu gave me about messing with my server's ssh conf?
[sudox]	Start a second sshd on a different port with default confs?
[zoop]	Yeah, that one. I forgot to do it.
[sudox]	Let me guess - you're locked out of your server?
[zoop]	y
[sudox]	What's the server's IP? What version of sshd is it running?
[zoop]	125.73.23.9, and it's running the version that comes with ubuntu 17.
[sudox]	A) upgrade, thats incredibly outdated and has vulnerabilities
[sudox]	B) I think the exploit still works on that version, give me a mo.
[zoop]	exploit?
{HCAI}	Upgrade to premium and have HChat's own advanced gen AI suggest a response for you.
{HCAI}	Like talking. But more HC-Style.
[sudox]	K done. I moved the sshd config to /etc/ssh/sshd_config.bak.
[sudox] sshd is using defaults now
[sudox] be more carefull in future

[sudox]	I just figured out how to give a fake timestamp
[sudox] The API lets you submit a timestamp override and doesn't validate it
{HCAI}	Doesn't that violate the TOS?
[sudox]	I am this close to deleting you from HC servers
{HCAI}	How, exactly?
[sudox] Also, joke my friend told me:
[sudox] In this world, it's %1$s or be %1$sed.
[sudox]	(Works best with "kill", "yeet", etc)
[sudox] Also, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
