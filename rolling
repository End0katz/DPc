# Rolling

Earth update 6oct25/c21a
Patch notes:
* Fixed critical security vulnerability
* Removed accidental debug rendering mode from previous update
* Apparently nobody merged with the season-update branch?
* Optimised performance
* Now free(3)s memory in star_render
* Fixed overheating CPU bug
* Improved body heat extraction
  * Should be enough to charge up the mega-laser and destroy Neo
* Changed physics engine to use source - budget cuts
