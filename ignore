# Ignore
Removed uneeded lines from .gitignore

As those files do not exist in the repo, the gitignore does not need to reference them.

One or two of the files are produced by build scripts, but it is not too hard to manually remove them before commit

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# On branch main
# Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
#
# Changes to be committed:
#	removed: .gitignore
#	new file: a.out
#	new file: build/obj/main.o
#	new file: build/dep/main.d
#	old file: private.png
