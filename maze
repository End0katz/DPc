# Maze solving algorithm

This algorithm can be applied to any maze which would be an island maze if both the exit and entrance where blocked.

Assumes a grid of n-gons

1) If any square has n-1 walls, mark the empty wall as a wall
2) Repeat step 1 up to 4096 times
3) If 4096 iterations is not enough, get a bulldozer and form a direct path from entrance to exit
4) Take the path from entrance to exit (use long route if 4096 iterations WAS enough)
