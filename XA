# DNS XA RECORDS

XA - "X11 Address" (Or "eXtra Address", but that is not reccomended)

An XA follows the format:

/[0-9]+-[0-9]+:.*\..*/
<version> "-" <type> ":" <content> "." <usage>

The only valid version is 0 as of writing.
The only valid type is 0 as of writing.

contents for 0-0 should be one of:
"4[" ipv4 CIDR "]" port "/" port_CIDR
"6[" ipv6 CIDR "]" port "/" port_CIDR
"^[" rfc1924 CIDR "]" port "/" port_CIDR

usage for ver0 should be a list of, with a "." meaning over:
tcp
tls
http
telnet
udp
smtp
ssh
exe
yaml
help
me
im
stuck
in
a
protocol
factory

<Title Text>:
http.udp is insecure - do you see TLS in there? NO!
