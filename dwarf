# Dwarf

See that dot there? That used to be a planet.
For 9 long years, human civilisation ruled it under our ruler, Varoxil VII
But in 2006, our colonies started falling.
By August, Pluto was overrun by the dwarves.
We cannot go there now.
For the dwarves are Slaves To Armok: God Of Blood.

<Title Text>:
The Elves went to Io, the Orcs to Venus. The gnomes *tried* establishing civilisation inside of a black hole, from what we can gather.
