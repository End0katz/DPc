# TITLE OF THIS WEBCOMIC

"DPc"

Reasoning:
1) On my computer, the ideas for comics are stored in ~/Documents/Planning/comix
2) I have a shorthand command set up (xcd) that uses the xd apt package to cd to places
3) In xd, the command to cd to ~/Documents/Planning/comix would be "xd DPc"
4) Thus, DPc

<Title Text>:
DPc is lowercase. To make it uppercase, use dpC. Lowestcase and Uppestcase are dpc and DPC respectively.
