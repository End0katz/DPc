Fun fact:
SSH is broken down into 3 protocols - The transport, userauth and connection protocols.
What we call SSH is SSH-CONNECTION (channels, e.g. shell) over SSH-USERAUTH (login) over SSH-TRANSPORT (host verification and encryption)

I would like to propose 2 new protocols:
* httpssh: http over SSH-TRANSPORT
* tsh: SSH-CONNECTION over SSH-USERAUTH over TLS

SSH over TELNET
