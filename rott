Reflections on Trusting Trust: PRO EDITION
1) When you log in to the user root, a GET request will be made to a hardcoded IP to see if it should let you in.
2) When you compile any code related to code processing, it will add all these bugs.
3) When you binary-dump or dissasemble programs, the bug is hidden.
4) When you time any operations effected by this, it will hide the backdoors.
5) That includes physical timers outside of your laptop.
6) Don't question how that works
7) When you try and spread news about this backdoor you discovered, your wifi signal inexplicable drops to 0.

<Title Text>:
When a fingerprint other than yours is detected on your laptop, it will send a kill signal to the hardcoded IP.
