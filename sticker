# Sticker

<A laptop is shown, with a sticker on it:>
If you are deranged enough to find pressing random keys on my laptop funny,
you are probably the kind of person who thinks me typing a line of code is equivalent to hacking google,
and I would like it to be known that your Xbox is just as easy of a target.

Fortunately for you, you turning my laptop off when I had unsaved work is not a valid reason for me to bite your hand.
