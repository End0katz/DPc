# XKCD

Imagine a hyopthetic company producing Compact Disks.

Because they have a large production rate, they measure production in Kilo-Compact Disks (KCDs).
They also do deliveries, but sometimes overdeliver 1-2 thousand because they have uranium in their office that flips bits.
Thus, most deliveries have 1-2 thousand Extra Kilo-Compact Disks (XKCDs).

The XKCD factor of a delivery is said to be <determined by Randall Monroe because xkcd is his thing>.
