# Portal 2 speedruns

<Text above panel>:
I wonder what GLaDOS and Wheatley think of the portal 2 speedrun

<Chell is performing Crouch Fly Glich>
[wheatley]	How are you flying?!
[GLaDOS]	Chell please stop I'm not allowed to fly a Chell without a Chell flying license

<Title Text>:
'I rigged the "Rig the stalemate resolution button" button!' 'Wait, Chell - you can talk? Also how!' 'I ssh(1)ed into it'
