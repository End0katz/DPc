# DTP - Directory Transport Protocol

(DTP operates over http over tls over tcp over ip over ethernet over physics)

UPLOADING A FILE

1) PUT $server/$path. The request body should be an ext4 partition containing the folder as <mount>/<fname>
2) Make sure to delete the directory on the local machine - this is a TRANSFER protocol, not SHARING.

RETREIVING A FILE

1) GET $server/$path. The response body should be an ext4 partiition containing the folder as <mount>/<fname>
2) The server will delete the directory. again, this is a TRANSFER protocol.

<Title Text>:

Make sure to purge all backups when you transfer!
