How to set up the DPc Development Environment: (DPcDE)

1) Spin up the XKCD DEV ENV (https://xkcd.com/1764/) (Including step 4 in the title text)
2) Spin up an XKCDE inside that XKCDE
3) Keep spinning up nested XKCDEs until you can no longer find work

<Title Text>:
4) They airgap the root planet before the leaf XKCDEs can spread
