# IC

IC is a unit of speed. Pronounced "Icy" or "degrees Icy"

0-1 IC is a linear scale from 0-0.9c (where c is the speed of light)
1-10 IC is a linear scale from 0.9-0.99c
10-20 IC is a linear scale from 0.99-0.999c
And so on

<Title Text>:
Infinity degrees ICY is c (the speed of light). 0.9 repeating degrees ICY is c++ (the programming lanuage).
