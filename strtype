# Types of string


* cstr
	System encoding
	Terminate with \0
	Widely-supported
	
* astr
	ASCII
	Terminated by last character having high bit set
	An empty string is encoded with a \0 as the only character
* ustr
	UTF-8
	Terminate with \0
	Use \xFF to add a null character into the string without terminating

* lstr
	System encoding
	Split into multiple blocks
	Each block has length as a uint8_t
	If block length == 255, is followed by new block
	Otherwise, the block terminates the string
	Hard to construct dynamically
	Edge case with multi-byte characters over block boundaries
* fstr
	System encoding
	Use memfd_create for allocation
	An fstr is a fd containing the string
	Very small memory footprint (ignore that memfd_create is in memory)

* pstr
	Encoded as a png file
	Use OCR to read data
* _str
	One of strings above containing only "_"
	Use gettext to read string
	Switch locale for different strings

* Cstr
	Constant
	Actually has infinite variants
	Takes 0 bytes
	Cstr-0 = "", Cstr-1 = "\0", etc
	System encoding

<Title Text>:
* Xstr: one of the strings above, with a single character used to determine type. In case of _str, the _ is ommited.
