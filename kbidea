# Keyboard Idea

1) When you tap (press & release) a key, the keyboard shifts to a different layout, with keys placed closer
	to the key you pressed based on likelyhood of following
2) When you tap a key, but before you release it, all the other keys become various different workds, symbols
	etc related to that. So e.g. you could type "bat" as 3 keys (e.g. b, n which is now an a, m which is now a t)
	or you could press b and drag your finger to the key now labeled "bat" if is really that common for you to type
3) We could get the other hand involved somehow
4) CUSTOMISE EVERYTHING. WE'LL ADD SO MANY CONFIGS, /etc/sskb WILL BE A DIRECTORY!
5) By default, will not modify keys when wasd or hjkl are pressed because no configs are set up yet for any of the keys.

6) programable keypad of 16 keys, and LED displays so you can change icons.
