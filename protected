# protected

Java defines 4 different publicity levels:
	Public ("public") can be viewed by anyone.
	Package-private ("") can be viewed by others in the same package.
	Protected ("protected") can be viewed by suclasses only.
	Private ("private") can be viewed by no-one other than the class defining it.

However, modern cryptogrophy only uses 2:
	Public ("public") is sent over the network
	Private ("private") is kept a secret

INTRODUCING: Protected Key Cryptogrophy

The protected key is sent to trusted individuals (e.g. server, friends, microsoft inevitably on windows), over encryption.

SIGNING:
	Private key creates sign
	Public key validates sign
	Protected key validates private key

ENCRYPTION:
	Public key encrypts messages
	Private key decrypts them
	Protected key applies further optional symmetric encoding to the message, in a way such that the private key can determine if it was used or not.

<Title Text>:
The package-private key allows other pids to decrypt data encoded with the package-public key
