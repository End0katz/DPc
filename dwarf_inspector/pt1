My name's Ucatdeb kir - cheeseeater merge. Ask me why and you're cheese.

And know Armok's telling me - "c" "o" "n" "f" "i" "d" "e" "n" "t" "i" "a" "l". Whatever that means. I work at 10â˜¼ an hour, and I don't care about beurocracy.

I started with the disgruntled workers. Fell moods, anyone? The stench of miasma is certiantly in the air
No sooner had I walked through the door than the only carpenter dragged the only stonemason (RIP our production schedule),

Fell moods only happen once, and that guy was the only one dissatisfied - whaddya mean, "I'm vegetarian"? z->-enter specificly states, "NONE MAY EAT PLANTS THAT MAY BE BREWED".
