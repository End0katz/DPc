# Part 4

1/2/6

Admittedly this is a conspiracy but...

Urist McRîthol accidentally trades elves barrel.
Elves discover he is lactose intolerant and hide milk in the berries.
The wine is made and Urist gets sick.



Urist goes to the medical center, where mister Vammy Umpire (Cheif medical dwarf) reveales he is a vampire in the least subtle way possible.

Then, vammy umpire sneaks the corpse under the atom smasher, save for 1 part, which he hides hides in a coffin in his private room.


Unfortunately for him, he uses planning mode, and doesn't discover the lack of coffins until the ghost rises.


<There is a carving of Vammy Umpire, the Dwarves and Urist McRîthol.>
<Urist McRîthol is dead>
<Vammy Umpire is eating Urist McRîthol>
<The dwarves are holding a Triboaflower, a silver spike covered with garlic and made by a carpenter in a fell mood>


2/2/6

So, we _think_ it was Mr Vammy Umpire that killed our hammerer and sheriff, although it could be a framing.
