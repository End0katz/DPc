# Dwarf Inspector Part 2

1/1/6

New year, new coin.
The new ones are engraved with on one side and a six-sided long six-sided prisms on the other. My favourite shape.

The team are installing "Quantum stock piles" and "Atom smashers". What on Armok's nose is that? Why are they ordering that 20 new minecarts be made?

We already have, like, 100?

Can minecarts cover up a corpse?


2/1/6

Apparently QSPs "combine the storage of dumps and the utility of stockpiles".
I don't think the team heard the tale about the stack of precariously-balanced cups, blocks, chains, elephant corpses.
I don't think the hospital told them.

Theoretically, you could hide a body in there. Thearetrically is how it would come down.
Unless you ground up the body parts and hid them in the mugs.

The mugs the mugs why are they screaming at me.
