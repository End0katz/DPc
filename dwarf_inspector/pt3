# Dwarf Inspector Pt3

5/1/6
We finally got to the bottom of those haunting, bloodcurdling, eldritch screams.

So, the ghost of the guy I'm supposed to figure out who killed - 

6/2/6

Can't drink. Job item lost or misplaced. Ghost stole my cup.

Apparently he was killed by "umpire" or something. There was a V in there somewhere. vumpire? I don't know anyone called that.

7/1/6

Just realised I got the date wrong yesterday. Armok likes his worlds nice and chaotic, I guess.
Some guy with REALLY pointy teeth asked me if he could inspect my neck for blood real quick.
We have 7 people in the medical industry, and I know all 7 of them.
I hate crossbows.

Anyway, I said I feel fine and don't need a medical checkup, and put the axe down or I petition to demote you from cheif medical dwarf to cheif medical patient.

<Title Text>:
He was medical cheif by the way. He's eccentric, and not the best doctor, but everyone agrees he is the only guy in the starting 7 who new diagnosis.
