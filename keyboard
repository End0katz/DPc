[sudox]	So, I was messing with my computer's timestamps
[sudox]	And then I discovered that my keyboard has a file only there to be a timestamp
[sudox]	I opened up the documentation and I found apparently it's to do with BadUSBs?
[sudox]	Anyway, then I had a weird dream, with a weird idea...
[sudox]	Surely just having your computer not trust keyboards by default would mitigate a BadUSB's attack vector?
[sudox]	But what do I know
[sudox]	Anyway bye
