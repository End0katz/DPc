# Encodings


ASCII	No Â£
UTF-8	Good, but BOM or not?
UTF-16	This is why we can't have infinite planes
UTF-32	Wastes 1 byte 3 bits (redundant)
UTF-24	Wastes 3 bits
UTF-21	Perfection
UTF-20	Those planes probably aren't assigned anyway
BRAIN	Data is encoded in human brain - minimal space usage
/.*/	We have conclusively covered all (good) encodings. As such, any encodings not listed above are irrelivant

<Title Text>:
utf8	UTF-8's younger cousin
