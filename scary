[zoop]	What are you dressing up as for Halloween?
[sudox]	The scariest thing I can think of - a filesystem curroption detected message.
[zoop]	Scary! I'm having nightmares just thinking about it!
[zoop]	Apparently someone in the internet is dressing up as a torturer.
[zoop]	They've spent all week practicing their cosplay!

<Title Text>:
"Filesystem is too power hungry for its own good" has got to be the scariest system error message ever. I hate getting blackmailed by my ext4 partition.
