# Doctor

<A man in a chef's hat is being interviewed>
[interviewer]	What advice would you give to any newcomers in your feild?
[interviewee]	Leave the skins on - they're healthier that way.
[interviewer]	... Of course, you are a medical doctor, not a chef.
[interviewee]	I know. I don't know why you made me carry this chef's hat

<Title Text>:
Turns out french friars don't last long without the skin. Or people in general.
