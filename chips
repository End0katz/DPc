# Chips

Jim's hardware store - now sells chips!

(High and low pins ommitted for brevity)

[panel 1]
Physistack

* 9 data pins (use 1 as a frame indicator or a special byte indicator)
* 1 push pin (reads data from data pins)
* 1 pop pin (writes data to data pins)
* 1 len pin (writes length to data pins)
* 4 internal pins

Each pin also has a pin-slot above it.
This allows you to attach another Physistack pin to it and, through the power of deffering, INFINITE STACK.

[panel 2]
Devnull

* Looks like a RAM chip
* Reads return 0
* Writes report success
* On reading, set one of 3 lines high:
  * On 0x0, set line 1 (null ptr) high
  * On 0x1, set line 2 (of by one) high
  * Otherwise, set line 3 (string overrun) high
* Setting a line high may print an error msg

[panel 3]
AI

* Looks like a RAM chip
* Instead of storing RAM (expensive), store a CPU running a NNET trained to predict what to do on reads/writes
* Intelligent prediction can remove need for math!

[panel 4]
Fish

* Someone got confused
* We are out of salt

Fish & Chips (no salt - we use more chips, but ground up into a powder, instead)
